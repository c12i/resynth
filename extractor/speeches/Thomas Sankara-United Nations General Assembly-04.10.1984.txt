Mr. President,

Distinguished delegates,

Ladies and gentlemen,

I bring fraternal greetings from the people of Burkina Faso, the land of upright people.

I speak on behalf of a people who have chosen to stand upright and speak the truth.

I speak on behalf of a people who have decided to take their destiny into their own hands, without submitting to any form of domination, exploitation, or humiliation.

Burkina Faso is not speaking here through me.

Through me speaks the voice of all those who suffer from the world order that prevails today.

I speak for the hungry, the illiterate, the barefoot, the homeless, and the victims of imperialism.

I speak for those who are crushed by debt, strangled by structural adjustment, and condemned to misery in the name of a so-called international order.

This order has been established without us, against us, and continues to function without us.

We are here to denounce it.

The present international economic system is unjust and immoral.

It condemns the majority of humanity to live in misery while a small minority enjoys obscene luxury.

It is a system in which the rich become richer and the poor become poorer.

It is a system that turns human beings into commodities and reduces entire peoples to instruments of profit.

We refuse to accept this situation as inevitable.

We refuse to accept hunger as destiny.

We refuse to accept ignorance as fate.

We refuse to accept dependence as the future of our peoples.

We say no to the domination of one people by another.

We say no to the exploitation of one class by another.

We say no to the pillage of our resources in the name of cooperation.

Our country is poor, but our people are rich in dignity.

Our people understand that true development is not measured by the accumulation of goods, but by the liberation of human beings.

Development must be conceived as a process that puts people first, not profit.

It must free women and men from ignorance, disease, and fear.

It must allow each individual to flourish fully, materially, intellectually, and culturally.

We do not accept aid that humiliates.

We do not accept aid that perpetuates dependence.

We do not accept aid that dictates our choices and compromises our sovereignty.

He who feeds you, controls you.

That is why we have chosen to rely first on our own efforts.

We know that this path is difficult.

We know that it demands sacrifices.

But we also know that it is the only path that leads to dignity and freedom.

Imperialism is not only external.

It also lives within our societies, through corruption, privilege, and submission.

That is why we have undertaken a revolution not only against external domination, but also against internal injustice.

Our revolution is democratic and popular.

It is carried out by the masses themselves, not by a small elite.

It is a revolution that gives land to the peasants, dignity to women, and hope to the youth.

Women’s liberation is not an act of charity.

It is a fundamental necessity for the triumph of the revolution.

A revolution that excludes women is a revolution that fails.

We refuse to export our raw materials at giveaway prices while importing manufactured goods at exorbitant cost.

We refuse to be a reservoir of cheap labor and raw materials for the industrialized world.

We refuse to mortgage the future of our children to pay debts we did not contract.

The debt is a cleverly managed reconquest of Africa.

It is a new form of slavery.

Those who led us into debt were not accountable to our peoples.

And those who demand repayment today are not accountable for the consequences.

We therefore say that the debt cannot be repaid.

Not because we refuse to honor commitments,

but because we refuse to die.

If Burkina Faso alone refuses to pay, I will not be here at the next General Assembly.

But if all of Africa refuses,

I assure you I will be here, with the support of my people.

We call for a united front of oppressed peoples.

We call for solidarity among nations that refuse exploitation.

We call for a new international order based on justice, equality, and mutual respect.

Let us dare to invent the future.

Let us dare to break with the past.

Let us dare to build a world in which no child dies of hunger,

in which no woman is humiliated,

and in which no people is condemned to silence.

Fatherland or death,

we shall overcome.
