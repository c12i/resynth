Your Majesties,

Your Royal Highnesses,

Distinguished members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee,

Distinguished guests,

Ladies and gentlemen,

I stand before you and the world humbled by this great honor,

and inspired by the acknowledgment that the Nobel Committee has given to the critical links between environment, democracy, and peace.

I am particularly grateful for the recognition of the work of the Green Belt Movement,

an organization that began with a simple idea:

that ordinary citizens, especially women,

could protect the environment while improving their livelihoods.

I accept this award on behalf of the people of Kenya,

particularly the women of Kenya and Africa,

who have worked tirelessly to restore degraded environments,

raise their families, and build strong communities.

This award is also for all those who believe that peace is indivisible

and that it cannot exist without environmental security,

social justice, and respect for human rights.

In the course of history,

humanity has had to confront many challenges,

but perhaps none more urgent than the need

to care for the environment that sustains us.

As we celebrate the dawn of the twenty-first century,

we are confronted with new challenges that require a shift in our thinking

and a renewal of our commitment to shared values.

Environmental degradation and resource depletion

are increasing at alarming rates,

threatening livelihoods, human dignity, and peace.

In Africa, women are the primary caretakers of their families,

and they are often the first to feel the effects

of environmental degradation.

When the land is degraded,

women must walk longer distances to find firewood and water,

leaving less time for education, income generation,

and participation in community life.

It was this reality that inspired the Green Belt Movement.

In 1977, we began to plant trees,

first to provide firewood,

then to prevent soil erosion,

restore watersheds,

and improve food security.

Over time, we came to understand

that the environment cannot be conserved

without addressing issues of governance,

human rights, and empowerment.

Poor governance and corruption

lead to the mismanagement of resources,

environmental destruction,

and social conflict.

We learned that sustainable development

requires democratic space,

where people can participate in decisions

that affect their lives.

Through the Green Belt Movement,

we encouraged communities to reclaim their power,

to protect their environment,

and to hold leaders accountable.

We discovered that when people are empowered,

especially women,

they become agents of change.

Tree planting became a symbol of this empowerment.

Trees are living symbols of hope.

They represent peace and conflict resolution,

because a healthy environment supports livelihoods

and reduces competition over scarce resources.

Throughout my life,

I have seen how environmental destruction

goes hand in hand with the erosion of democratic space

and the suppression of human rights.

Conversely,

I have seen how restoring the environment

can restore hope, dignity, and peace.

As a young girl,

I remember pristine forests, clear streams,

and abundant biodiversity in my homeland.

Many of these have disappeared,

sacrificed to short-term economic gain

and poor decision-making.

We must reverse this trend.

We must recognize that the earth’s resources are finite

and that we have a moral responsibility

to manage them sustainably.

The environment is where we all live.

Development is what we all do

in attempting to improve our lot within that abode.

Therefore, the two are inseparable.

I believe that the Nobel Peace Prize

sends a powerful message:

that protecting the environment is not a luxury,

but a necessity for peace.

I call on world leaders

to embrace sustainable development,

strengthen democratic institutions,

and respect the rights of all people.

I also call on young people

to be agents of change,

to plant trees,

to protect the environment,

and to stand up for justice.

As I conclude,

I reflect on a proverb from my community:

“When we plant trees,

we plant the seeds of peace and hope.”

Let us continue to nurture those seeds.

Let us work together for peace,

for environmental integrity,

and for the well-being of future generations.

Thank you.
