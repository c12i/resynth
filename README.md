# 🟣 About This Experience

**What you're seeing and hearing is not random.**  
This is an audiovisual exploration of political speech — where each word's emotional tone is translated into color, sound, and motion.

## 🎨 Visual Meaning

### **Color**

Each dominant emotion is mapped to a distinct color:

- **Joy** → Golden Yellow
- **Anger** → Crimson Red
- **Sadness** → Deep Blue
- **Fear** → Violet
- **Disgust** → Acid Green
- **Surprise** → Pink
- **Neutral** → Gray

### **Shape Behavior**

The shape reacts and deforms based on the emotion:

- **Anger**: Sharp, erratic bursts
- **Sadness**: Slow, drooping motion
- **Joy**: Buoyant, uplifting spirals
- **Fear**: Jittery, unstable flickers
- **Disgust**: Twisted, warped flow
- **Surprise**: Chaotic pulses
- **Neutral**: Calm and minimal

### **Color Gradients**

When multiple emotions are detected in a single moment, colors blend into gradients to reflect emotional complexity and internal conflict.

## 🔊 Sound Design

Each emotion triggers a unique synthesized note and timbre:

- The **pitch** and **oscillator type** represent the emotional weight.
- Sounds are tuned to create a **melodic backdrop**, even as the emotional tone shifts.
- Ambient tones run continuously, while sharper notes mark transitions between emotions.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Speech-to-Text**: Transcribes political speech in real time or from archived audio.
2. **Emotion Detection**: Uses a machine learning model (`distilroberta-base`) to classify emotions line-by-line.
3. **Data Mapping**: Each emotional label controls a set of visual and audio responses.
4. **Web Technology**:
   - **Canvas 2D + JavaScript**: Renders the responsive shape.
   - **Tone.js**: Generates real-time synthesized audio.
   - **React + Remix**: Powers the single-page application.

## 💡 Why It Matters

> “Political speech isn’t just about words — it’s about feeling.”

This project invites you to **listen differently** — to _see_ conviction, _hear_ frustration, and _feel_ hope.

It's an attempt to **amplify emotion**, where it too often gets lost in rhetoric or noise.
