Mr. President,

Distinguished delegates,

We meet here today while some nations continue to behave

as if they were ordained by God

to rule over the affairs of others.

Zimbabwe will never be a colony again.

We are not prepared to surrender our sovereignty

to those who seek to recolonize us

through economic pressure,

political interference,

and illegal sanctions.

Britain and its allies have imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe

not because we have violated human rights,

but because we reclaimed our land.

They want us to reverse land reform

and return our country

to white settler control.

That will never happen.

The land question in Zimbabwe

is a closed chapter.

It is irreversible.

We took back what was stolen from us

by the gun.

If it was wrong to take land by force,

then it was wrong to colonize Zimbabwe in the first place.

Those who lecture us on democracy

have blood on their hands

from Iraq,

Afghanistan,

and elsewhere.

They should first put their own houses in order

before pointing fingers at us.

We reject the hypocrisy

of those who claim to be champions of freedom

while denying us our right

to economic self-determination.

Zimbabwe is not a basket case.

Zimbabwe is under attack.

And we shall resist that attack

with every means at our disposal.

We will not be intimidated.

We will not be dictated to.

We will not betray the struggle

that liberated this country.

Let it be known

that Zimbabwe stands firm

against imperialism,

racism,

and neo-colonial domination.

The voice of Zimbabwe

is the voice of Africa.

And Africa will never submit again.
